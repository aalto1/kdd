Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining

04/23 During the previous day I started a Spark session but I was not able to load the Microsoft Academic Graph as RDD.

04/24 I redownloaded and unzipped the MAG using an Ubuntu VM, then I saved each component in a Blob Storage in a way that I can easly upload it into Spark

04/25 Spark session successfully started - 3 worker and 2 master - MAG successfully loaded
